# Random Student Selector

This is a simple Java application that selects a random number of students from a list of names stored in a text file.

## Installation

To use this application, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Git (optional)

You can download the latest version of the JDK from the official Oracle website:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

Git can be downloaded from the official Git website:
https://git-scm.com/downloads


To install the application, you can clone the repository using Git:

git clone https://github.com/ahmetgltkn/RandomStudentSelector.git

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it to a directory of your choice.

## Usage

To use the application, you need to have a text file containing a list of names, with each name on a new line. By default, the application looks for a file named `studentList.txt` in the `src/main/resources` directory. You can modify this behavior by passing a command-line argument with the file name and location.



The application will select the specified number of students at random and print their names to the console.
